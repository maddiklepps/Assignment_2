## About Me

I’m Maddi Klepps! I grew up in Appleton, WI and currently live in
Ringle, WI. My boyfriend and I recently bought a house with wooded land,
and we enjoy watching all the wildlife there! I work a full time job as
a Benefit Configuration Analyst at Navitus, and I’m in school part time
at FVTC for the Data & Analytics program. I have a sister who is roughly
two years younger than me who is also in this program. In my free time I
enjoy reading, working out, being outside, playing video games, and
spending time with my loved ones!
